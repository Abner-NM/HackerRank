# Python Functions
This subfolder contains examples and practice exercises related to Python functions. Functions are blocks of code that can be defined and called to perform specific tasks or operations. They help to organize and modularize code, making it more reusable and easier to maintain.

## Contents
- **README.md**: This README file provides an overview of the contents of the "Python Functions" subfolder, along with instructions on how to run the example functions and exercise solutions.

## Usage
To use the code in this subfolder, you can follow these steps:
- Clone or download the entire "Python" repository to your local machine.
- Navigate to the "Python/Functions" subfolder.
- Open the Python scripts (example_functions.py and function_exercises.py) in a Python IDE or text editor.
- Read the comments and instructions in the scripts to understand the purpose and usage of the functions.
- Run the scripts using a Python interpreter or IDE, and observe the outputs or results.
- Modify the functions or create your own functions to practice and experiment with Python functions.
